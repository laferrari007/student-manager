# 📚 Student Database Management with SQLite

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repo-blue?logo=github)](https://github.com/laferrari007/student-manager)

This project demonstrates how to manage a student database using SQLite on Linux, running inside a Docker container based on Ubuntu.

## 🐳 Environment

- The whole project is designed to run in a Docker container with Ubuntu Linux.
- All scripts and commands assume a Linux/Ubuntu environment inside the container.

## ✨ Features

- 🧑‍🎓 Students are generated by the `scripts/generate_students.py` script.
- 🔢 The script prompts for the number of students to generate (default is 500).
- 💾 All data is stored in the `data/studenti.db` SQLite database (table `students`).
- ➕ The script can be run repeatedly – new students are added to the existing database.
- 🗑️ To completely delete all students and the database, use the `scripts/delete_students.sh` script.
- ❌ The `delete_students.sh` script deletes the `studenti.db` database and, if `students.txt` exists, also deletes system users listed there.
- ⚠️ System user accounts for students are no longer created automatically (the create_students.sh script has been removed).

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `scripts/` – 🛠️ scripts for data generation and management (e.g., generate_students.py, delete_students.sh)
- `data/` – 💾 database and exported data (e.g., studenti.db)
- `docs/` – 📄 documentation

## 🏗️ SQLite Installation

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3
```

## Database and Table Creation

The database is generated by the `scripts/generate_students.py` script and stored in `data/studenti.db`.

Manual table creation (extended structure):
```bash
sqlite3 data/studenti.db "CREATE TABLE students (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, jmeno TEXT, prijmeni TEXT, email TEXT, adresa TEXT, telefon TEXT, kontakt_osoba TEXT, pojistovna TEXT, datum_narozeni TEXT, rodne_cislo TEXT, poznamka TEXT);"
```

## Viewing Records

Show all students:
```bash
sqlite3 data/studenti.db "SELECT * FROM students;"
```

## Working with the Database in Python

Example Python script to display students:
```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('data/studenti.db')
c = conn.cursor()
c.execute('SELECT * FROM students')
for row in c.fetchall():
    print(row)
conn.close()
```

## Basic sqlite3 Commands

Start the sqlite3 database:
```bash
sqlite3 data/studenti.db
```

In interactive mode, you can use these commands:
- `.tables` — list all tables in the database
- `.schema` — show SQL definition of tables
- `.headers on` — show column headers
- `.mode column` — display output in columns
- `SELECT * FROM students;` — show all records from the students table
- `.exit` or `.quit` — exit sqlite3

Example interactive session:
```sql
.headers on
.mode column
SELECT * FROM students;
.exit
```

## More Options
- You can generate random students using Python and insert them into the database.
- Data can be exported to students.txt for use in other scripts.
- The database can be easily extended with more columns (e.g., phone, birth date, etc.).

If you need a specific script or extension, let me know!
